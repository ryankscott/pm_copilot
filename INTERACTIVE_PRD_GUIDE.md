# Interactive PRD Creation Guide

Your PM Copilot now features an enhanced **Interactive PRD Creation** system that transforms PRD creation from a one-off generation into a collaborative, step-by-step conversation with AI.

## What's New?

### ðŸ”„ **Conversational Approach**
Instead of generating a complete PRD in one go, the AI now guides you through creating a comprehensive PRD through a series of questions and iterative discussions.

### ðŸ’¾ **Session Persistence**
Your interactive sessions are automatically saved and restored when you return to a PRD, allowing you to continue where you left off.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Guided Structure**
The AI proactively suggests what sections to work on next and asks clarifying questions to ensure nothing is missed.

## How It Works

### Starting an Interactive Session

1. **Open a PRD** and click the "AI Assistant" button
2. **Select the "Interactive PRD" tab**
3. **Configure your preferences:**
   - **Tone**: Professional, Casual, Technical, or Executive
   - **Detail Level**: Brief, Standard, Detailed, or Comprehensive

4. **Quick Start Options:**
   - ðŸ“± Mobile App Feature
   - ðŸ”Œ API Integration  
   - ðŸš€ User Experience Improvement
   - Or describe your own project

### The Conversation Flow

The AI follows a structured approach to PRD creation:

#### **Phase 1: Discovery**
- Product/feature overview and value proposition
- Target audience and primary users
- Problem being solved and user pain points

#### **Phase 2: Requirements Gathering**
- Goals, success metrics, and business objectives
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- User stories and acceptance criteria

#### **Phase 3: Technical Planning**
- Technical considerations and constraints
- Architecture and implementation details
- Integration requirements

#### **Phase 4: Project Planning**
- Timeline, milestones, and dependencies
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and KPIs

### Interactive Features

#### **Smart Context Awareness**
- The AI remembers everything discussed in the session
- References previous points when asking follow-up questions
- Builds upon information already gathered

#### **Action Buttons**
- **Apply to PRD**: Add AI-generated content directly to your document
- **Ask for More Details**: Request deeper information on any topic
- **What's Next?**: Get guidance on the next logical step
- **Refine Content**: Improve existing sections

#### **Session Management**
- **Auto-save**: Sessions are automatically saved as you chat
- **Progress Tracking**: See how many exchanges you've had
- **Session Reset**: Start fresh when needed
- **Resume**: Pick up where you left off when returning to a PRD

## Best Practices

### **Be Specific in Your Initial Request**
Instead of: *"I want to build an app"*
Try: *"I want to create a mobile app for tracking personal fitness goals with social sharing features"*

### **Engage in the Conversation**
- Answer the AI's clarifying questions thoroughly
- Ask for examples when you need inspiration
- Request specific sections when you know what you want

### **Iterate and Refine**
- Use "Ask for More Details" to expand on interesting points
- Apply generated content and then continue the conversation
- Don't hesitate to ask for revisions or different approaches

### **Leverage the Structure**
The AI will guide you through standard PRD sections:
- Executive Summary
- Problem Statement
- User Personas & Target Audience
- Goals & Success Metrics
- User Stories & Requirements
- Technical Specifications
- Timeline & Milestones
- Risk Assessment

## Example Interaction

```
You: "I want to create a PRD for a new user authentication system for our web platform"

AI: "Great! Let's build a comprehensive PRD for your authentication system. To get started, I'd like to understand a few key things:

1. What type of web platform is this for? (e.g., e-commerce, SaaS, social network)
2. What authentication methods are you considering? (email/password, social login, multi-factor authentication)
3. What's driving this project - is this replacing an existing system or building from scratch?
4. Who are your primary users and what's their technical comfort level?

Let's start with the platform type and current authentication situation."

You: "It's a B2B SaaS platform for project management. We currently have basic email/password auth but need to add SSO, MFA, and better security features for enterprise clients."

AI: "Perfect! A B2B SaaS platform with enterprise clients has specific authentication requirements. Let me help you structure this PRD properly.

## Executive Summary
**Project**: Enhanced Authentication System for B2B SaaS Platform
**Goal**: Implement enterprise-grade authentication with SSO, MFA, and enhanced security

## Problem Statement
Current basic email/password authentication is insufficient for enterprise clients who require:
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enhanced security compliance

Now, let's dive deeper into your user base. Can you tell me:
1. What size companies are your typical enterprise clients?
2. Do they have specific compliance requirements (SOX, HIPAA, etc.)?
3. What SSO providers do they commonly use?"
```

The conversation continues, building the PRD section by section with your input.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start broad, then get specific** - Begin with the overall vision, then drill down into details
2. **Use the quick action buttons** - They help maintain conversation flow
3. **Don't try to cover everything at once** - Let the AI guide the structure
4. **Ask for examples** - The AI can provide templates and sample content
5. **Iterate freely** - You can always refine and improve sections later

## Technical Notes

- Sessions are stored locally in your browser and synced with the server
- Each PRD has its own conversation history
- Settings (tone, detail level) are preserved per session
- The AI has context about your existing PRD content

This interactive approach ensures you create comprehensive, well-structured PRDs while maintaining the flexibility to focus on what matters most for your specific project.
